=================
[codesearch](http://code.google.com/p/codesearch/) is a really great
utility—check it out if you haven't already. My only gripe is that it's kinda
tedious to maintain different search indexes at once.

This script tries to help by replacing the default search index file with a
directory full of different index files. You access them with a new argument to
csearch/cindex.
